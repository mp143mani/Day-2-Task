                 *The window object is the topmost object of the DOm.
                 *It represent a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.
                 *It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
                 *It is the object of the browser.
                 *Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
                 *We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
                 *The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
                 *Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.

    example-----:   window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser.

                 *It is loaded inside the window  and It is the object of window property.
                 *All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
