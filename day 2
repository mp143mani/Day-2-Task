A).  Window Objects:
                 *The window object is the topmost object of the DOm.
                 *It represent a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.
                 *It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
                 *It is the object of the browser.
                 *Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
                 *We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
                 *The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
                 *Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
    
    syntax------:  window.propertyname;
    
    example-----:   window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser.
    
    
 
 B).  Document:
                 *The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page.
                 *With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
                 *It is loaded inside the window  and It is the object of window property.
                 *All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
                 *We can access the document from a window using the window. document
                 *The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
                 *Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
                 
    
       syntax-------: document.propertyname;

       example------: document.title :  will return the title of the document
      
     

     

Introduction:
In the world of web development, JavaScript plays a pivotal role in creating dynamic and interactive web pages. Two essential objects in the JavaScript environment are the document and window objects.
While they might seem similar, they serve distinct purposes and offer unique functionalities.
In this blog, we'll dive into the differences between these two objects and understand their roles in shaping the modern web browsing experience.

Understanding the Document Object:
The document object represents the entire HTML document that is currently loaded in the browser. It serves as an interface to manipulate the structure, content, and styling of the web page. Through the document object,
developers can access and modify various elements within the HTML document, such as paragraphs, headings, images, forms, and more. Some common tasks performed using the document object include:

DOM Manipulation: Developers can add, modify, or remove elements from the HTML document using methods like createElement, appendChild, removeChild, etc.

Content Modification: Text content, attributes, and even CSS styles of elements can be changed programmatically.

Event Handling: The document object is used to attach event listeners to elements, enabling interactions like clicks, form submissions, and more.

Form Handling: Form elements can be accessed and manipulated using the document object, allowing for data validation and submission.

Exploring the Window Object:
On the other hand, the window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page. It provides an interface to control the browser's behavior and interact with the user. 
Unlike the document object, which focuses on the content of the page, the window object is responsible for the browser-level tasks. Some key functionalities of the window object include:

Global Scope: Variables and functions declared in the global scope become properties and methods of the window object, making them accessible throughout the script.

Navigation: The window object provides methods like window.open and window.location to manipulate the browser's navigation, such as opening new windows or changing the URL.

Timers: JavaScript timers, such as setTimeout and setInterval, are managed by the window object. These timers facilitate delayed execution of code or repeated actions.

Browser Dimensions: Information about the browser's dimensions (width and height) and viewport can be accessed using the window object.

Key Differences:
The primary differences between the document and window objects can be summarized as follows:

Focus: The document object deals with the content and structure of the web page, while the window object is concerned with the browser window and its interactions.

Scope: Variables declared outside functions become properties of the window object, making them global. However, the document object does not directly handle variable scope.

Methods: The document object provides methods to manipulate elements and content, while the window object offers methods for browser control and global interactions.

Events: Events related to user interactions (e.g., clicks, keystrokes) are often handled through the document object, while browser-level events (e.g., resizing, loading) are managed using the window object.

Conclusion:
In the realm of JavaScript and web development, understanding the distinction between the document and window objects is crucial. The document object empowers developers to manipulate the content and structure
of web pages, while the window object offers control over browser behavior and interactions. By leveraging the unique capabilities of these objects, developers can craft engaging and responsive web experiences that
captivate users across the digital landscape.
